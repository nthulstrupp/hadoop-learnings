Notes 


Creating an STRING, when it is not possible to have ARRAY as datatype 

hive: Using collect_set with a delimiter

COLLECT_SET returns an array, with which you can then concatenate the entries into a single comma-separated value using CONCAT_WS


SELECT
	product_id, 
	concat_ws("-", collect_set(companyName)) as concatenate_companyNames 
FROM 
	External_Table
GROUP BY 
	product_id

Then using this in practise you can now filter using `array_contains`

SELECT 
	product_id
FROM 
	concatenateData_Table
WHERE
	array_contains(split(companyName,'-'),companyA) -- return a BOOLEAN so no need to =TRUE
