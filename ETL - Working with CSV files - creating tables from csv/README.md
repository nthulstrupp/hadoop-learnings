## Downloading data to csv

Usually we like to handle data in either a table or agg. a output that is not millions of lines. 

BUT in some cases one wants to export a big csv file as a output, using this script you will not block your hadoop cluster or do any harm as you will simple create a file to hdfs and download it directly from there
